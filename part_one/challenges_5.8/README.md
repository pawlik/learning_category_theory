> 2. What is a product of two objects in a poset? Hint: Use the universal construction.

Let a, b be different objects in a poset.

It seems that there can be two products: 

c1, with single elemement pair(a,b) with morphisms fst1 :: c1 -> a, fst1 a _ = a, scnd1 :: c1 -> b, scnd1 _ b = b

c2, with single element pair(b, a) with morphisms fst2 :: c2 -> b, fst2 b _ = a, scnd2 :: c2 -> a, scnd2 _ a = a
