> What kind of order is this
> a) A set of sets with the inclusion relation: 𝐴 is included in 𝐵 if every element of 𝐴 is also an element of 𝐵

- Composition: yes, `A included_in B included_in C => A included_in C` 
- No loops, or `A included_in B && B included_in C => A == B`
- any 2 objects in relation: no `A is not (), and B is not (), and B and A is (), then A and B are not in inclusion relation`

This is a partial order
